                Place rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water
                until water runs clear (it will take about 2 minutes of
                rinsing). Tap bottom of strainer with palm of your hand until
                water no longer falls from strainer (it should be well drained).
                Transfer rice to a medium saucepan along with 2 1/4 cups water.
                Bring mixture to a full boil then reduce heat to low, cover with
                lid and simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat, keep covered and
                let rest 15 minutes.

                Meanwhile, in a small saucepan combine 4 Tbsp of the vinegar
                with the sugar and salt. Heat over medium heat, cook and whisk
                until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat, let cool while rice
                is resting then pour vinegar mixture over rice and toss to
                evenly coat.

                In a small mixing bowl whisk together mayonnaise with sriracha.
                Thin with 1 1/2 tsp of water if desired. Transfer to a sandwich
                size resealable bag. Set aside.

                In a small mixing bowl whisk together soy sauce and remaining 1
                Tbsp vinegar, set aside. In a large mixing bowl gently toss
                together crab meat, cucumber, carrots, nori, ginger and avocado.
                Divide prepared rice among 4 or 5 bowls. Top with crab mixture
                then spoon soy sauce mixture over top of each serving. Cut a
                small tip from one corner of the resealable bag holding the
                sriracha mixture, drizzle over each serving. Serve immediately.

                Remove the chicken from pan and keep warm.

                Melt the remaining butter in the same pan. Add the onion and
                cook, stirring, until soft. Add the rice, stirring to coat it in
                the buttery juices. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add a ladleful of
                hot stock to rice mixture; stir constantly until liquid is
                absorbed. Continue to add stock, 1 ladleful at a time, stirring
                constantly until liquid is absorbed before adding more (this
                will take about 35 mins or until rice is tender but firm to the
                bite). After 30 mins, stir in the peas.

                Add the lemon peel, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve
                the rice topped with chicken and additional Parmesan shavings,
                if desired.

                Heat chicken stock and keep hot over low heat.

                In medium sauce pan heat butter; add half the leek and sauté
                until transparent.

                Add rice and sauté, stirring, for 2 – 3 minutes until rice has
                white center.

                Add white wine and stir.

                Start condimenti.

                When wine is almost absorbed add a 1/3 cup of stock, stir.  (No
                need to stir constantly but do stir from time to time.)

                When stock is almost absorbed add another 1/3 cup and continue
                adding 1/3 cup at a time and stirring.  Before adding the last
                1/4 cup taste a few kernels of rice.  They should be just ‘al
                dente’ – slightly resistant to the tooth, but fully cooked.  If
                more stock is needed add it 1/8 cup at a time and waiting until
                almost completely absorbed.  At this point risotto will be thick
                but not stiff – there will still be visible liquid and it will
                not hold it’s shape on a plate.

                Add the Parmesan, Condimenti, and stir gently.

                Spoon into a bowl or risotto platter and serve.

                Condimenti:

                Heat oil in a medium skillet, add remaining half leek and sauté
                until transparent.

                Add chicken, broccoli, carrot and sauté 5  – 7 minutes.

                Add 1/4 cup of hot stock, cover, reduce heat and cook until
                vegetables are tender and chicken done.

                Remove from heat and keep warm until needed.

                Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat

                Remove from wok and set aside.

                Using the same pan, add in the garlic and ginger and stir to

                Turn the heat to medium-low and pour in the sauce mixture, then
                mix in the cornstarch mixture. Stir the sauce for 1 to 2 minutes
                to thicken, then add the cashews and stir to coat everything
                with the sauce. You can add a little water if the sauce looks

                breasts. Fold the edges of the foil over the chicken and

                Preheat the grill to medium/medium high (about 450 degrees F).
                Place the chicken, bell peppers, onion, and zucchini in a large
                bowl. Top with the lime juice, chili powder, cumin, garlic
                powder, salt, onion powder, and cayenne. Toss to coat.Lay 6
                large pieces of heavy-duty foil on the counter (if not using
                heavy duty, use two pieces of regular foil stacked on top of
                each other for each packet). Generously coat the foil with
                nonstick spray. Divide the chicken and vegetables among the 6
                pieces of foil, then wrap them to form packets: bring up 2 sides
                of the foil so the edges meet. Seal the edges, making a tight
                1/2-inch fold, then fold again, allowing space for heat to
                circulate. Fold in the ends to seal.Grill for 8 to 12 minutes,
                until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the
                vegetables are crisp-tender. Carefully open the foil and allow

                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

                In a small bowl, add the mozzarella, sliced basil, halved
                tomatoes, vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
                Gently mix to combine. Set aside.

                Cut the ends off the zucchini. Cut it in half, lengthwise. Then,
                cut it into 1/2 inch slices (making a half moon shape). Repeat
                with the yellow squash.

                Tear off two long pieces of aluminum foil (about 1 1/2 feet
                each). Divide the zucchini and yellow squash between the two
                pieces of foil, gathering the squash in the middle of each
                sheet.

                Drizzle the squash with the olive oil. Sprinkle the squash with
                the Italian seasoning. Then, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and
                pepper. Set aside.

                Place one of the chicken breasts on a cutting board and cover it
                with a piece of plastic wrap. Use a mallet to pound the chicken
                thin and flat (about 1/2 inch thickness throughout). Repeat with
                the other chicken breast.

                Divide the tomato mixture between the two chicken breasts.
                Arrange the tomato mixture in a strip 1 inch away from one of
                the edges of the chicken. Starting with the edge closest to the
                filling, roll the chicken around the filling. Use 2-3 toothpicks
                to secure the seam. Try to keep the toothpicks from sticking too
                far out of the chicken or else they could puncture the foil.

                Place the stuffed chicken breasts on top of the squash piles.
                Sprinkle each chicken breast with a pinch of salt and pepper.

                Bring the longest ends of the foil up over the chicken and roll
                them together. Then roll the short ends in, making sealed
                packets. Place the packets on a large baking sheet.

                Bake for 25 minutes, until the center of the chicken is 165
                degrees F. Let them cool for 5 minutes.

                Drizzle the chicken with extra balsamic vinegar before serving.

                Cut 12 (12x16") pieces of heavy-duty foil. Layer 2 pieces of
                foil on top of each other to create 6 stacks. Line top pieces of
                foil with parchment paper cut to the same size.

                Toss scallions, potatoes, sausage, oil, salt, and pepper in a
                large bowl. Divide mixture among prepared packs, arranging in
                the center of each piece of parchment. Bring edges of foil
                together to enclose each pack, covering completely, then crimp
                to seal packs closed.

                Prepare a campfire or grill for medium, indirect heat,
                preferably with hardwood or hardwood charcoal. Let coals burn
                until covered with ash and glowing red with no black remaining.

                Place packs side by side directly onto hot coals or grill and
                cook, rotating with tongs occasionally, about 5 minutes.
                Carefully remove 1 pack from heat and check if ingredients are
                steaming hot. If necessary, return pack to coals and continue to
                cook, 5–10 minutes more.

                Transfer packs with tongs to a flat surface and carefully open
                them (they will be full of hot steam). Top each pack with
                spinach, then crack 1 egg into the center of each and season
                with salt and pepper. Reseal, return to coals, and cook until
                egg whites are opaque but yolks are still runny, 4–5 minutes.

                Carefully remove packs from coals, open, and sprinkle with
                cheddar, if using. Serve immediately.

                Packs can be assembled and chilled for up to 2 days or frozen
                for up to 1 month.

                incorporated.

                Season pork tenderloin with salt and fresh ground pepper and
                coat with the peach mixture.

                Place the pork tenderloin on a large sheet of aluminum foil, cut
                several slits across the top and insert peach slices in each
                slit. Set aside.

                Cut the new potatoes in half, place in a bowl, season with salt
                and pepper, and toss with a tablespoon of olive oil.

                Transfer potatoes to prepared foil, arranging them around the
                pork tenderloin.

                Seal the foil packet well and place in the refrigerator for an
                hour or two.

                Preheat your grill for 10-15 minutes with all the main burners
                on high.

                Remove prepared foil packet from refrigerator and let stand at
                room temperature for about 15 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE PACKET.

                Place the foil packet over high heat on the grill; about 425
                degrees F.

                Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, turning, until internal temperature
                of pork reaches at least 150 degrees F.

                Remove from grill and let stand a few minutes.

                Open up the packet and serve.

                Cook the macaroni according to package directions. Drain and set
                aside. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium low heat.
                Cut the onion into thin rings and add to the butter in the pan,
                sauteing over low heat until fragrant and golden, about 20
                minutes.

                Meanwhile, remove the skin and the seeds from the squash. Cut
                the flesh into small cubes. Bring the broth to a boil and add
                the squash. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until fork tender. Drain,
                reserving 1/2 cup broth, and transfer squash to the blender. Add
                the onions, milk, salt, and reserved broth and puree until
                completely smooth and creamy. This should yield about 4 cups
                sauce.

                Pour the pureed sauce over the cooked noodles and add the
                shredded cheese. Stir to melt the cheese; add water or milk to
                adjust consistency as needed. Serve with parsley, salt, and
                pepper to taste.

                Turkey Meatballs

                Heat oven to 375°F.

                Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

                In a large bowl, mix together the ground turkey, egg,
                breadcrumbs, worcestershire sauce and salt.

                Form into 1.5 tablespoon meatballs and arrange on the baking
                sheet.

                Bake for 22-25 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from oven
                and allow to cool slightly.

                Honey Chipotle Glaze

                In a medium pan, combine the honey, stock, salt, lime juice,
                adobo sauce and optional chipotle pepper.

                Stir together and cook until completely combined.

                In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold
                water until no lumps remain. Stir into the pan and continue
                stirring and simmering until slightly thickened.

                Remove from heat and toss meatballs in the glaze, until coated.

                Cilantro Lime Cauliflower Rice

                In a large pan, heat the olive oil.

                Add the bell pepper and onion, and cook for 3-4 minutes, until
                slightly softened.

                Add the cauliflower rice, lime zest and salt. Cook for 2-3 more
                minutes, until cauliflower rice is slightly softened (but not
                mushy!).

                Stir in the lime juice and cilantro leaves, then remove from the
                heat.

                Assemble lunch bowls

                Divide the cauliflower rice between four meal prep containers.

                Divide the meatballs between four bowls.

                Drizzle with extra glaze to taste.

                handle, about 4 hours or overnight.

                Preheat oven to 350°. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough

                If you’re yearning for a soulful soup, but don’t feel like
                slaving over the stove, turn to this simple recipe for a mostly
                homemade seafood “bisque.” First, you’ll sauté chopped shrimp in
                a saucepan and set aside. Next, in that same pan, you’ll heat a
                splash of brandy (which gives the soup an earthy complexity), a
                can of tomato soup, and cream for just five minutes. Ladle the
                soup into bowls before topping with shrimp and chives. The
                transformation is pretty incredible. This recipe takes a basic
                can of soup and morphs it into a satisfying, well-rounded meal.
                One that comes together in under 20 minutes, too.

                minutes; transfer to plate.

                heat. Add onions, bell pepper, garlic and pepper flakes, to
                taste. Cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.

                Increase heat to medium-high and stir in cooked rice, green
                onions and soy sauce. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add peas and cook 1
                minute more. Remove from heat. Add sesame oil and mix well.
                Garnish with peanuts, if desired.
